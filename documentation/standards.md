# Standards 
Standards define the structure, format, and framework for data and databases. They are widely adopted, either within a specific institution (i.e. University or Archive) or across multiple institutions (i.e. American Libraries or International Council of Museums)

Some examples:

[Library of Congress Extended Date Time Format (EDTF)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/edtf.html)

[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)
