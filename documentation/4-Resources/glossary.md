# General Data Management Terms

* Structured data: data that is organized and formatted within a database or other such repository to enhance data searchability and to allow for more effective processing and analysis.

* Data cleaning: the process of ensuring consistency and accuracy of records stored within a table or database, such as spelling, date order, or consistent identification.  

* Standards: the rules or documented agreement on the format, structure, representation, usage, etc of the ways in which data are described or recorded. They are the best practices of how data and metadata should be described, formatted, or included in a data set.

* Controlled vocabulary: a set of standardized terms, thesauri, or subject headings that are preferred for a data set. It ensures consistency of vocabulary to control for spelling differences, homonyms, or name variations for a single defined entity.

* Data Model: An abstract, visual representation of data objects for a group or organization in order to structure a database. A good data model follows formalized standards, or best practices, in format and structure.

* Conceptual Model: A type of data model that establishes entities, their properties, and the relationship between each entity. The model is used to formalize entity relationships to represent the semantics of an organization.

* Ontology: An ontology defines the elements -- entitites and their properties -- within a data structure. It formalizes the conceptual data model with a common controlled vocabulary, identifiers, and structure that allows for system interoperability of the database. 

* Universal Unique Identifier (UUID): a 128-bit number used to reliably identify an object or entity within a database.

# Arches Specific Terms

For a larger collection of Arches Terminology, see the [Arches Glossary Here](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/glossary/)

* Arches Designer: 

* Arches Collector:

* Reference Data Manager: The Reference Data Manager (RDM) is a core Arches module to create and maintain concept schemes (controlled vocabularies) or thesauri. It enables the creation and maintenance of controlled vocabularies for use in dropdowns and controlled fields within the various Arches Resource forms.
