# Clean Data 

Clean data is consistent in terminology, formatting, and structure through the entirety of the table or database.

For example: 
consistent date formatting i.e. 2019-10-02 instead of 10/2/19

preferred terminology i.e. United States of America instead of USA

Organizational standards help determine preferred format and structure

[OpenRefine](https://www.openrefine.org) is a great, open source tool to help clean data
