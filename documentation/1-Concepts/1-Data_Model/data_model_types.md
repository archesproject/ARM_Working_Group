#Types of Data Models

In addition, there are different types of data models, often corresponding to the type of database or system. For example, a relational data model, which corresponds to relational databases, is based on a table structure. A graph data model, which often corresponds to graph databases, focuses on the data itself and the relationships between data. As a note, Arches Resource Models are graph data models.
