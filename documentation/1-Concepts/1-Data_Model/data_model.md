#What is a Data Model? 

A data model establishes the overall organization of data in any given database or system. 

Data models can work on a conceptual level as well as a functional level. A conceptual data model provides the overall vision and framework for data organization but might not be adequately interpreted, structured and encoded for a particular software application. A data model that is also functional, such as an Arches Resource Model, is ready to be loaded into and expressed through a software application, in this case, Arches.

This documentation focuses on modeling functional data models, Arches Resource Models, that rely on conceptual frameworks.
