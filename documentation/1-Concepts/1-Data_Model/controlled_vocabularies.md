# Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled Vocabularies are the set of standards chosen for preferred terminology used within a database.

They help create consistency when data can be incredibly messy, with misspellings, homonyms, and cultural/national differences.

Preferred vocabularies are established and stored in thesauri that should be shared for enhanced data interoperability.

Here is a [primer to controlled vocabularies](https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Controlled-Vocabularies_Jan2020.pdf) posted in the [Implementation Considerations](https://www.archesproject.org/implementation-considerations/) for the Arches Project.

Some examples:

[The Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

[Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)

The Arches Project manages its Controlled Vocabularies and Thesauri through the Reference Data Manager (RDM). For a more detailed guide on the RDM, [click here](***link to RDM slide # Reference Data Manager***).
