# Key Elements to Structured Data

The following elements help to form the foundation for data that is meaningful and useful:
1. Clean Data
2. Controlled Vocabularies
3. Universal Unique Identifiers
4. Triples

Structured data consists of clean and consistent data, with terminology that is defined by established controlled vocabularies. All database types can benefit from data that have these two elements. 

Structured data also has elements that are essential in graph databases: the ability for each instance of data to be uniquely identified, preferably through a universal unique identifier, and the ability to create meaninful relationships between data instances through the use of triples.
