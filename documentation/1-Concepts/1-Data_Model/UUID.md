# Universal Unique Identifiers

Universal Unique identifiers (UUID) are associated with any given entity within a database structure. Each entity has a uniquely coded identifier that ensures exactly what it is. A UUID is a 128-bit number that differentiates the term from any other possibilities found online. This 128-bit number is difficult to replicate, as there are 3.4 x 10^38 possible alphanumeric combinations (an extremely large number!).

Arches utilizes UUIDs, e.g. 662b53c0-2e26-4b87-a6d0-109b7f611e05 

Similarily, a UID (Unique Identifier) or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) may be unique within an organization, but not necessarily unique universally. For example, a university student identification number is a UID that will not be repeated within the context of that university. A Social Security number also is a UID because it is specific to one single person within one single context and cannot be repeated.

A UID can also link an entity to a controlled vocabulary. The AAT record number can replace the name of any entity because it links back to the original preferred authority record. For example, the AAT record for 'database' is http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300028543, with the UID being 300028543.

Usage of a UID or UUID is important within a database or spreadsheet in order to faciliate sorting and filtering information, as well has link back to specific entity within the database system.
