# Semantic Formats: RDF

RDF (Resource Description Framework): A classification schema to construct conceptual data models. The RDF is a set of standards specified by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF). 

The RDF is constructed by a series of expressions about a resource that are formatted in a [semantic triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/Overview.html).
This semantic triple is structured: subject-predicate-object

The RDF defines a model and a set of elements through a domain-specific syntax to encode information in a machine-readable format.

Other formats: 

* [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/): The required syntax to express RDF graphs in XML.

* [OWL (Web Ontology Language)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/): A semantic web language to describe the relationship about things and relationships between them. In addition to RDF and SPARQL, OWL is part of the W3C Semantic Web technology stack.

* [SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL): a query language used to parse and navigate information stored within an RDF graph. It translates the complex web of interlinked data into tabular data, making data more easily accessible.

* [SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/): a simple way to express structure and content within a concept scheme. SKOS is built upon RDF for simple publication of data as Linked Data.
