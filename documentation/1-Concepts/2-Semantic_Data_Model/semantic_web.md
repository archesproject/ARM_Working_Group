# Semantic Web

The Semantic Web is the vision to make the world wide web machine-readable, such that all online data and resources are linked by a Unique Resource Identifier (URI). This will promote the navigation between resources and to improve automation for information retrieval online. 

The goals of the Semantic Web are to:
- Structure meaningful content on web pages to promote machine automation in accessing and processing data
* Encode the semantics (meaning) of the data through designated frameworks (RDF and OWL)
- Promote Natural Language Processing and Semantic Search to support enhanced navigation and searchability on the web and from a variety of different sources.
