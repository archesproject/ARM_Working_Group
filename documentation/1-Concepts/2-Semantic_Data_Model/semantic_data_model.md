#What is a semantic data model?

When previously describing this triple:

IMAGE OF .red[a person (entity)] .blue[is identified by (property)] .darkgreen[a name (entity)]

both entities and the property are understandable to humans who understand English because they are written in a natural language. However, a computer only sees strings of letters, so both entities and the property must be given additional machine-readable meaning, so that a computer can parse and interpret the data.

A semantic data model is a graph data model for which each entity and property in the data model is associated and encoded with semantic metadata that describes what each entity and property refers to in a way that conforms to standard computer formats.

Further, to ensure that data can be more portable, interoperable, and reusable over the long term, it is essential that the conceptual framework for as well as the format of the semantic metadata be based on recognized standards.
