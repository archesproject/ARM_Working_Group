#Semantic Ontologies

An ontology is a formal organization of a data structure or knowledge graph based on standards, establishing relationships between entities and their properties. An ontology is a way to structure semantic understanding shared by members of a specific domain. 

For the Cultural Heritage domain, of which the Arches Resource Modeling Working Group is associated, there are prevalent existing ontologies, developed by domain experts, that are built and widely used for institutions to model and integrate their own data resources according to to established structure and guidelines.
