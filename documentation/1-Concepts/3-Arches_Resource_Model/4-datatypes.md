# Data Types

Each Node in a Branch/Resource Model is assigned a data type that defines what kind of data can be entered for that Node and how data is entered. Here is a listing of some of the data types that can be assigned to a Node in Arches:

* **Semantic** - Nodes with a semantic data type carry no data, but serve to enforce the semantic structure and grouping of nodes.
* **String** - This data type supports the entry of alphanumeric text.
* **Number** - This data type supports entry of numbers.
* **Date** - This data type supports the entry of date and time. 
* **Geojson Feature Collection** - This data type supports the entry of geospatial data. 
* **File** - This data type supports the upload of various file types and how they are visualized. 
* **Resource-Instance** - This data type supports the connection of Resource Models to each other via a specific Node.
* **Concept** - This data type supports the selection of data from a controlled vocabulary managed by the Arches Reference Data Manager.
* **Domain** - This data type supports the selection of data from a list that is not managed by the Arches Reference Data Manager. 
* **IIIF Annotation** - This data type supports the import and annotation of images served by a IIIF image server.
