# Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled Vocabularies are the set of standards chosen for preferred terminology used within a database.

They help create consistency when data can be incredibly messy, with misspellings, homonyms, and cultural/national differences.

Preferred vocabularies are established and stored in thesauri that should be shared for enhanced data interoperability.

Here is a [primer to controlled vocabularies](https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Controlled-Vocabularies_Jan2020.pdf) posted in the [Implementation Considerations](https://www.archesproject.org/implementation-considerations/) for the Arches Project.
