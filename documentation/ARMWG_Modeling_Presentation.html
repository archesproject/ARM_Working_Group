# Introduction

The information in this section introduces some concepts that will be helpful to understand before engaging with the ARM WG methodology for Arches modeling.

Generally, the concepts have a direct relationship to the modeling process and why it's important.

name: data_model
#What is a Data Model? 

A data model establishes the overall organization of data in any given database or system. 

Data models can work on a conceptual level as well as a functional level. A conceptual data model provides the overall vision and framework for data organization but might not be adequately interpreted, structured and encoded for a particular software application. A data model that is also functional, such as an Arches Resource Model, is ready to be loaded into and expressed through a software application, in this case, Arches.  

IMAGE of a conceptual model and an actual Arches Resource Model.

This documentation focuses on modeling functional data models, Arches Resource Models, that rely on conceptual frameworks. 

.footnote[Further reading:<br>
* link(s)?]

---
name: data_model_types
#Types of Data Models

In addition, there are different types of data models, often corresponding to the type of database or system. For example, a relational data model, which corresponds to relational databases, is based on a table structure. A graph data model, which often corresponds to graph databases, focuses on the data itself and the relationships between data. As a note, Arches Resource Models are graph data models.

[<img src="images\tigergraph-database-compare.jpg" height="200px" />](images\tigergraph-database-compare.jpg)

Because Arches Resource Models are graph data models, it is important to understand [.orange[structured data]](#structured_data) and how it forms the basis for graph data models.


.footnote[Further reading:<br>

<!--A good conceptual data model provides the technical details for a programmer to implement the data model within a database and/or interface that will allow the stored data to be navigated and searchable. -->

---
name: structured_data
# Structured data

Structured data is data that is organized and formatted in a way that is machine-readable, or in other words, usable by computer applications for processing, analysis and other functions. 

In relational databases, the structure of the data is created by tables. However, in order to increase portability, interoperability and longevity, data should be structured to be self-describing and independent of any particular software application. 

To understand how structured data can achieve this, it is important to understand some key elements of structured data.

.footnote[Further reading:<br>
* link(s)?]

---
name: structured_data_elements
# Key Elements to Structured Data

The following elements help to form the foundation for data that is meaningful and useful:
1. [.orange[Clean Data]](#clean_data)
2. [.orange[Controlled Vocabularies]](#controlled_vocabularies)
3. [.orange[Universal Unique Identifiers]](#UUID)
4. [.orange[Triples]](#triples)

Structured data consists of clean and consistent data, with terminology that is defined by established controlled vocabularies. All database types can benefit from data that have these two elements. 

Structured data also has elements that are essential in graph databases: the ability for each instance of data to be uniquely identified, preferably through a universal unique identifier, and the ability to create meaninful relationships between data instances through the use of triples. 

---
name: clean_data
# Clean Data 

Clean data is consistent in terminology, formatting, and structure through the entirety of the table or database.

For example: 
consistent date formatting i.e. 2019-10-02 instead of 10/2/19

preferred terminology i.e. United States of America instead of USA

Organizational standards help determine preferred format and structure

[OpenRefine](https://www.openrefine.org) is a great, open source tool to help clean data

.footnote[Further reading:<br>
* link(s)?]

---
name: controlled_vocabularies
# Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled Vocabularies are the set of standards chosen for preferred terminology used within a database.

They help create consistency when data can be incredibly messy, with misspellings, homonyms, and cultural/national differences.

Preferred vocabularies are established and stored in thesauri that should be shared for enhanced data interoperability.

Here is a [primer to controlled vocabularies](https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Controlled-Vocabularies_Jan2020.pdf) posted in the [Implementation Considerations](https://www.archesproject.org/implementation-considerations/) for the Arches Project.

]
---
name: UUID
# Universal Unique Identifiers

Unique identifiers (UUID) are associated with any given entity within a database structure. Each entity has a uniquely coded identifier that ensures exactly what it is.

A Social Security number is a UID because it is specific to one single person and cannot be repeated.

A UID can also link an entity to a controlled vocabulary. The AAT record number can replace the name of any entity because it links back to the original preferred authority record.

.footnote[Further reading:<br>

---
name: triples
# Triples

A triple is a data configuration in which a data entity is linked by a relationship property to another data entity. 

For example, .red[a person (entity)] .blue[is identified by (property)] .darkgreen[a name (entity)]

---
name: semantic_data_model
#What is a semantic data model?

When previously describing this triple:

.red[a person (entity)] .blue[is identified by (property)] .darkgreen[a name (entity)]

both entities and the property are understandable to humans who understand English because they are written in a natural language. However, a computer only sees strings of letters, so both entities and the property must be given additional machine-readable meaning, so that a computer can parse and interpret the data.

A semantic data model is a graph data model for which each entity and property in the data model is associated and encoded with semantic metadata that describes what each entity and property refers to in a way that conforms to standard computer formats.

Further, to ensure that data can be more portable, interoperable, and reusable over the long term, it is essential that the conceptual framework for as well as the format of the semantic metadata be based on recognized standards. 

.footnote[Further reading:<br>
* [link name](link url)]


---
name: semantic_standards
#Semantic Metadata Standards 

There are two types of standards that interact when it comes to semantic metadata:
* Standards that define the data format (i.e. RDF/XML)
* Standards that define the conceptual data framework or ontology (i.e. CIDOC CRM)



<!--Standards define the structure, format, and framework for data and databases. They are widely adopted, either within a specific institution (i.e. University or Archive) or across multiple institutions (i.e. American Libraries or International Council of Museums)

Some examples:

[Library of Congress Extended Date Time Format (EDTF)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/edtf.html)

[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)-->

The Arches Resource Model Working Group has made several assumptions when it comes to the Resource Models, Branches, and overall patterns that it has created. The two that will be discussed here are:

1. All Resource Models and Branches are encoded with the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model
2. The modeling patterns support the publication of Linked Open Data

#Domain expertise

The CIDOC-CRM has been developed by cultural heritage domain experts for those working in the cultural heritage field. 
The CRM provides the framework to build conceptual models for archives, libraries, and museums. Working with the CRM will allow
cultural heritage instututions to partner with other similar communities and to build information systems that support specialized research questions

More information about the CRM [can be found here](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/).

---
name: benefits_search 
#Information Search and Retrieval

Structuring your data into a data model, or schema, will enhance the searchability and findability of information stored within it.
The schema provides the outline for where and how the information is stored. The more detailed and precise your data models are, built using the Arches Designer,
the better return of search results for those using your Arches instance. Linked Data is a graph structure that can enhance searchability
by establishing semantic connections between resource elements.

---
name: benefits_sharing_interoperability
# Shareability and Interoperability 

Linked Data and semantic standardization allow the possibility for organizations to share their data with other institutions
who structure their data following the same guidelines. The benefit of sharing data in this way is to enhance collaboration between 
organizations and to share resources and work between multiple entities.

Structured data sets will enhance interoperability and data usability for a wider variety of computer and software systems.

---
name: arm_wg
# Role of the ARM WG
