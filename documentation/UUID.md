# Universal Unique Identifiers

Unique identifiers (UUID) are associated with any given entity within a database structure. Each entity has a uniquely coded identifier that ensures exactly what it is.

A Social Security number is a UID because it is specific to one single person and cannot be repeated.

A UID can also link an entity to a controlled vocabulary. The AAT record number can replace the name of any entity because it links back to the original preferred authority record.
