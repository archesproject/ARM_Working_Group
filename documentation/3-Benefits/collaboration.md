# What Do We Do and How Can You help?

The Arches Resource Model (ARM) Working Group is focused on providing consensus-based guidance on Arches Resource Models and constituent Branches, specifically on how to build and apply them. This work informs a repository of peer-reviewed Resource Models and Branches as well as providing documentation on basic modeling patterns for the creation of Resource Models and Branches. The adoption of ARM WG models and branches is meant both to facilitate deployments of Arches and to support the long term compatibility and interoperability of data generated in Arches.

More information about the ARM Working Group [can be found here](https://www.archesproject.org/arm-wg/) on the Arches Project website.

As an Open Source platform, the Arches Project encourages community development and support. 
We welcome collaboration through the contribution of software code, documentation, resource models, branches, etc that may be beneficial for others to use.
