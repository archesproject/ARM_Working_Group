The CIDOC-CRM has been developed by cultural heritage domain experts for those working in the cultural heritage field. 
The CRM provides the framework to build conceptual models for archives, libraries, and museums. Working with the CRM will allow
cultural heritage instututions to partner with other similar communities and to build information systems that support specialized research questions
