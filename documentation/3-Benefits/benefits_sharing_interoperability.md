# Shareability and Interoperability 

Linked Data and semantic standardization allow the possibility for organizations to share their data with other institutions
who structure their data following the same guidelines. The benefit of sharing data in this way is to enhance collaboration between 
organizations and to share resources and work between multiple entities.

Structured data sets will enhance interoperability and data usability for a wider variety of computer and software systems.
