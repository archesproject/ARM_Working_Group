# What is the role of the ARM WG?

The Arches Resource Model (ARM) Working Group provides guidance and methodology to create Resource Models and Branches for Arches instances. The goal is to help Arches users:

* Rapidly develop and/or implement high quality Resource Models and Branches
- Recognize the underpinnings for a good conceptual model
* Learn CIDOC-CRM modeling patterns
- Improve interoperability across data management projects
* Incorporate good data modelling practice into domains beyond cultural heritage
- Contribute new Resource Models/Branches or improve existing ones as a valuable member of the Arches community

We are focused on providing consensus-based guidance on Arches Resource Models and constituent Branches, specifically on how to build and apply them.The adoption of ARM WG models and branches is meant both to facilitate deployments of Arches and to support the long term compatibility and interoperability of data generated in Arches.
