# What are the benefits of adopting the ARM WG methodology?

There are several benefits to using ARM-reviewed Resource Models and Branches and/or the methodology established in ARM documentation to create Resource Models and Branches for your own Arches instance. The goal is to help Arches users to:

* Rapidly develop and/or implement high quality Resource Models and Branches
* Recognize the underpinnings for a good conceptual model
* Learn CIDOC-CRM modeling patterns
* Improve interoperability across data management projects
* Incorporate good data modelling practice into domains beyond cultural heritage
* Contribute new Resource Models/Branches or improve existing ones as a valuable member of the Arches community
