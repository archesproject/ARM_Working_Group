#Information Search and Retrieval

Structuring your data into a data model, or schema, will enhance the searchability and findability of information stored within it.
The schema provides the outline for where and how the information is stored. The more detailed and precise your data models are, built using the Arches Designer,
the better return of search results for those using your Arches instance. Linked Data is a graph structure that can enhance searchability
by establishing semantic connections between resource elements.
