# Data Model

A data model establishes the structure and organization, as determined by ontologies and semantic standardization, to a database.

The model is the framework for which data is organized.

A good conceptual data model provides the technical details for a programmer to implement the data model within a database and/or interface that will allow the stored data to be navigated and searchable.
